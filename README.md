## Welcome to Jake Lynch's Personal Site

I've worked in capital markets with a focus on digital assets for a couple of years.
From time to time, I'll discover something interesting that I'd like to share.
When I do, if I'm able to share it, I'll try my best to update this site and it in the section below.

### Links and Projects
